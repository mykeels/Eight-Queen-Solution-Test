# Eight-Queen-Solution-Test

This is an angular directive that helps you test your solution to the 8-queen chess problem.

### Description
The [eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, an ideal solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

The eight queens puzzle has 92 distinct solutions. If solutions that differ only by symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) of the board are counted as one, the puzzle has 12 fundamental solutions.

Use this angular directive to test your solutions to the eight-queens problem.
